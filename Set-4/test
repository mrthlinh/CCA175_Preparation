database - sample, table products
username - root, password - cloudera
	-mysql table products is already created
	-products data is located in hdfs at /user/cloudera/problem2/products


3. the orders records are stored in metastore table called orders in problem3 database

customer_fname		string
customer_lname		string
alias			string


7.orders data is stored as tab seperated in hdfs at /user/cloudera/problem7/data/orders
